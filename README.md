# todoapp
This is Todo application which can be used to add things to do which we might forget.
In this application, we can add things to do, check them when they're done and delete them as well. The list persists even after a reload when it is saved.
This is done by using javascript JSON parsing, event listeners and array method splice, localStorage property enables the list to persist.
